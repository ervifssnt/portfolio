SECTION 1: HERO SECTION
================================================================================

HERO TAGLINE:
"Aspiring Penetration Tester & Security Analyst"

HERO BIO (Main Text):
"Aspiring cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in penetration 
testing, secure web development, and vulnerability assessment. I combine 
offensive security skills from CTF competitions and Hack The Box with defensive 
programming practices to identify and remediate security gaps. Currently seeking 
internship opportunities to apply my technical skills in pentesting, security 
analysis, or GRC while contributing to real-world security initiatives."

================================================================================
SECTION 2: ABOUT ME
================================================================================

ABOUT ME TEXT:
"I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast from Jakarta, Indonesia, passionate about 
identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do. My journey began with CTF 
competitions, where I developed a systematic approach to problem-solving and 
learned to think like an adversary. This offensive mindset, combined with my 
secure development experience building payment processing systems, gives me a 
unique perspective on both breaking and defending applications.

Through my Google Cybersecurity Certificate and active participation in Hack 
The Box, I've built a strong foundation in penetration testing, web application 
security, and GRC fundamentals. My projects demonstrate practical security 
implementations – from building vulnerability scanners in Python to securing 
payment gateways in production web applications. I document my learning journey 
through detailed CTF writeups and open-source security tools on GitHub.

I'm seeking an internship where I can contribute my technical skills while 
learning from experienced security professionals. Whether it's conducting 
penetration tests, analyzing security vulnerabilities, or helping organizations 
meet compliance requirements, I'm ready to tackle real-world security challenges 
with curiosity, dedication, and a commitment to continuous learning."

STATS TO DISPLAY (Optional counter section):
- 4+ Hack The Box Machines Solved
- 10+ CTF Challenges Completed
- 1 Professional Certificate
